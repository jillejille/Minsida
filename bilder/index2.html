                ”―John Steinbeck</p>
                <p>“When it's 100 degrees in New York, it's 72 in Los Angeles. When it's 30 degrees in New York, in Los Angeles it's still 72. However, there are 6 million interesting people in New York, and only 72 in Los Angeles.
                    ”―Neil Simon</p>
                    <p>It is ridiculous to set a detective story in New York City. New York City is itself a detective story. 
                        ~ Agatha Christie </p>
                        <p>“I get out of the taxi and it’s probably the only city which in reality looks better than on the postcards, New York.
                            ~ Milos Forman</p>
